Crossings Cafe,"55 Waterloo Street Singapore, 187954",Fusion,"The pork chop is cooked and fried to a crispy lovely brown. It's Hainanese-inspired pork chop, but surprisingly also reminds the taste buds of Japanese katsu. A lovely fusion of taste, and with the comfortable dining ambience, simply a must-try. Plus, all of the restaurant's profits go towards charitable and social causes. ",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/5D892AFC-2219-4594-926B-68C03AD01326_aoubrb.jpg"
The Pound Cafe,"100 Jalan Sultan, #01-17B Sultan Plaza Singapore 199001",Café,"A very cosy Korean-owned cafe, with strong coffee and mouth-watering cakes that the cafe owner baked herself. The Single Origin and Pound Signature iced coffee is worth a try. Recommending their lovely ESPRESSO ROLL cake. In fact, the cakes and biscuits are all flavorful! Good coffee, wonderful cake, and a comfortable ambience to bask in on any afternoon.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/B1189155-981A-4732-9710-1B2BD4A88366_nhiaen.jpg"

Sixth Floor Oyster Cake,"407 Northshore Drive, Northshore Plaza I, #02-41 Punggol, Singapore 820407",Chinese,"Its Original Oyster Cake (S$3) is filled with oysters, whole prawn, minced pork, and chives. It is also topped with peanuts.

It started out as home-based business from Khung's 6th-floor HDB flat in Punggol. The demand for Khung's oyster cakes was apparently so good that he decided to open a physical stall at Northshore Plaza 1.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/236255428_375173407553776_8184112162643920936_n_upvg6w.jpg"

Huang Hong Ji Porridge,"Blk 269A Punggol Field #01-197, Singapore 822269",Chinese,"Earthy pork blood cakes are all but a memory in our hygienic city, in its place are delicate slices of Ikan Parang (fish) a saltwater fish which is more flavourful than the more commonly used snakehead (Toman), cuttlefish with a crunch of freshness and tender meatballs squeezed by hand, all hidden under the ladles of silky porridge.

All of this is topped off with what is now my new favourite crispy pork item- deep fried pig's intestine.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/Huang-Hong-Ji-Signature-Porridge_djyobo.jpg"
BBBurgers,"168 Punggol Field, #B1-05 Punggol Plaza, Singapore 820168",Korean,"BBBurgers, a Korean smashed burger kiosk was born out of their founder Vinn's idea of putting Korean barbecue ingredients into a burger. 

Though it took 24 hours for the chef to marinate the buttermilk gojuchang fried chicken thigh, it only took me 2.4 seconds to gobble it down. It was no surprise that the red chilli sauce went well with the fried chicken thigh.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/BBBurgers-wide-angle_h8lrhk.jpg"
Munchi Pancake,Yishun Park Hawker Centre,Street Food,"Lovely peanut butter MJK that taste really unique. They also sell in other flavors such as red bean x green tea flavor.

Say Seng Famous Tau Kwa Pau,"Dunman Food Centre #01-05, 271 Onan Road, Singapore 424768",Chinese,"The braised egg bits and fishcake slices were springy and soft, the cucumbers were crunchy and added a freshness to each mouthful, and the fried yam bits were addictively salty. All the ingredients were slathered in a thick braised duck sauce, which was rich and savoury.

When I paired it together with the silky tau kwa slices, it was absolutely divine. By itself, the filling might be too salty, so the silky-smooth tau kwa helped to balance out the savoury flavours.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/Dunman-Food-Centre-0047_mt2bdk.jpg"
Ah Kong Wah Kuih,"Chinatown Complex Food Centre, #02-116, 335 Smith Street, Singapore 050335",Chinese,"It turns out that wah kueh, meaning 'bowl cake' in Hokkien, is a traditional Hokkien snack and one of those rare hawker dishes that are quickly disappearing.

The Wah Kueh bears a resemblance to the more famous chwee kueh except that instead of savoury chai poh pieces on top, Ah Kong's one is covered in a brown sauce, minced garlic, and chilli sauce. If you eat it right there and then, you'll be served your wah kueh in a bowl that explains its namesake.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/Ah-Kong-Wah-Kueh-5_m8pnk7.jpg"

The ingredients included uniformly sliced ngor hiang and pork belly, half a braised egg, one fried fish meat nugget (which I mistook for fish cake) and crispy flour bits.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/50082488577_d7d869674e_o_zunpy4.jpg"
