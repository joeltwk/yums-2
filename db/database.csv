You can't say you've tried East Bistro without having had their unique Chef Special Pao Fan ($6.80/$13.60). For a small order, we got a generous bowl that was enough to make a full meal for two and more.

A waitress tipped in a side of crispy rice into chicken broth with chopped greens, chicken, and plain rice, generously garnished with sesame seeds. The grains instantly crackled when they touched the soup in an Instagrammable moment. I salivated as the aroma of the crispy rice wafted up in a mix with the mellow fragrance of the chicken broth.","https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/East-Bistro-flatlay_glpzgh.jpg"

We decided to go for the Deluxe Nasi Ambeng (S$32.90 for 2 pax, S$43.90 for 3 pax), which came with  14 different ingredients on a giant platter. All the dishes were amazing and the portions were really generous.

The first is the Sambal Goreng, one of my staples whenever I have nasi padang. This is basically fried tofu, tempeh and long beans cooked in a spicy coconut sauce ” a simple yet well-executed, delicious dish. I liked the different textures, and the tempeh was well-prepared with a clean nuttiness.

My second favourite is the Beef Rendang, which was extremely flavourful from the use of rich spices. The meat was tender and easy to chew with no gameyness.

The third would be the Bergedil, a fragrant deep-fried potato patty, with chunks in it. Dip this in their homemade sambal, which packed a nice punch, for a more intense flavour.","https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/coba-coba-5_b4fgel.jpg"

Nan Xiang Chicken Rice ,"271 Tanjong Katong Road,  Singapore 437054 ",271 Tanjong Katong Road,Chinese,"I first noticed the proportionately sliced char siew meat with an almost 50-50 lean meat and fat ratio. It is a very tender texture, and the meat is so soft and delicious. 

The sio bak is equally good. Lovely crispy skin and it has fattier cuts of meat than lean meat. 

I had the steamed chicken last, and it didn't disappoint as well. You get a soft tender chicken meat here, along with the fragrant rice which is not too greasy.

It is rare for a stall to get all their meats right - steamed chicken, sio bak and char siew. This stall is worth a journey if you love chicken rice and roast meats.  ","https://res.cloudinary.com/yumssg/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_600/eimg_5509_wy2jos.jpg"
