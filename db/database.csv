Eastern House of Seafood,"37 Jalan Pemimpin, MAPEX building, #B1-02, Singapore 577177",Cuisine,"Tea smoked chicken doesn't taste like poached, fried, roast, soya sauce or salt baked chicken. The flesh is soft-tender, juicy like the best poached chicken and skin is slippery smooth.

Half a bird like this costs $18 and a whole bird $36 at Eastern House of Seafood. This is a reasonable price considering that tea smoked chicken is time consuming and relatively tedious to make, so it is harder to produce in scale. 

It is cooked by steaming, then smoked in a covered wok with stir fried tea leaves and rock salt. Its amazing taste makes it totally worth it (despite costing more than other types of chicken).

According to Encik Ismail, hand-rolled pastry is still better than the ones made by machine as the corners of the curry puffs are crisp and tender, unlike the ones which are machine-made which can be tough.

One of the key ingredients in the curry puff is their chilli sauce which goes really well with the curry puff.  It is only mildly spicy,  but adds sweetness and extra umami to the karipap! Make sure you ask for it!

The dumpling was all shrimp with a bit of black fungus for crunch. The good size prawns were fresh, meaty, tender-crunchy, and sweet.

The strips of beef brisket were soft, juicy, beefy and saturated with savoury flavours. The tendons were soft and smooth like floppy slippery jelly and tasted nicely savoury from the sauce enveloping it.

I was pretty mind blown by this beef brisket noodle and giant shrimp dumpling.

The only letdown was how their signature chye poh was overpowered by their sauce blend. I had been expecting an extra dimension of flavour from the chye poh, but it was sadly masked by the rich dark sauce. Aside from that, they serve a great bowl of noodles with soup, perfect for a rainy day, and a hearty bowl of dry ban mian if you're searching for something heavier in flavour.

Feng Xiang Bak Kut Teh,"144 Upper Bukit Timah Road, #04-65, Beauty World Centre, Singapore 588177 ",Cuisine,"Out of the many fried porridge options presented to me, I went for one of the recommended ones on the menu: Sliced Fish Fried Porridge ($6.90). The piping hot dish was still gently bubbling and emitted a wonderful, smoky fragrance. It came topped with large pieces of lard, dried cuttlefish, fried shallots and spring onions for an extra boost of umami. 

The Herbal Bak Kut Teh (Soup) ($6.90 for small, $11.90 for medium) was a bubbling claypot of ingredients simmering in an aromatic broth that had seen long hours of brewing with quality herbs, ingredients and zero MSG.
